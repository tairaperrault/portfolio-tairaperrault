                <h2>MELTED</h2>
                  <p>Ever run out of ice cream at the most inconvenient time leaving your spoon feeling lonely?</p>

                  <p>Melted is a food delivery app focused around getting that cold nectar of the gods into mouths faster. From a to z, Melted allows users to customize their ice cream orders from the comfort of their rom-com watching couch to the back the line that no one wants to wait in. It’s an honest day's work but someone needs to do it.</p>

                <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
                  <p>Many problems come up when people think of ice cream; it melts too quickly, it falls onto the ground by accident, or the most cited problem, there just isn’t enough to eat. This feeling of ice cream deprivation always comes at the worst times too, usually when you are stuck at home, sitting in traffic, up in a hot air balloon, or standing in line for that darn awesomeness. No one specializes in delivering ice cream directly to consumers and that is just wrong. Sure there are other food delivery apps like Grubhub, DoorDash, UberEats, and the list goes on, but they deliver all types of food. They don’t give ice cream the special care it deserves, so there is no telling what shape your ice cream will be in when it arrives or how it will smell. Thanks Doug and your fish fry.</p>

                <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
                  <p>From their modern ice cream storefront that feels like it was ripped out of the 90s, Melted comes to you with a solution. Taking a page out of Insomnia Cookies’s book with their cookies, Melted’s delivery app allows customers to order ice cream straight to their doors, like they were Richie Rich with their own personal ice cream truck. No matter what time of night that craving hits, Melted has it covered, with their frozen trucks optimized to keep the precious cold. And for those that visit the store and just can’t wait inline, there is an option for that. They just access the app, place their order and Melted we’ll let them know when it’s ready.

                  <p>I created user personas based on the information gathered through an internet deployed survey, targeted toward people that love ice cream. This gave me insight into who my users would be.</p>

They are usually busy trying to make it that they sometimes forget to eat and/or go shopping so they would prefer for food to be delivered to them. This information lead me to make the personas of Amanda, a 20 year old, female, college student and Penny, a 27 year old, female, account executive.</p>
                  <p>My secondary users tended to be a bit older, 26-40 and skewed male. These men are in the thick of their jobs, probably have a family, and are overall busy with life. These men also tend not to be that great with technologically but would do anything to skip long lines and get back to their crazy schedules. This information lead me to make the persona of Jeff, a 34 year old, male, manager and father.</p>

                  <p>With my low-fi mockups looking pretty bare, I began thinking about what the brand for an ice cream shop and corresponding should be. With that in mind I went through entire exercises of brainstorming names, finding imagery and more, until everything just seemed to melt together.</p>
                  <p>Melted is a brand for it’s millennial users that are nostalgic for a time that seemed more simple. A time where they watched Nickelodeon with it’s wide rounded font of a logo and wild shapes of bold colors. It’s when they would chase ice cream trucks with their allowance money and just have fun being who they are. Melted is supposed to embody the feeling of the 90’s while still feeling modern and new, because ice cream never goes out of style.</p>

                <h3>HiFi MOCKUPS</h3>
                  <p>During my initial user tests I witnessed first hand what was and wasn’t working with my mockups. This knowledge helped me identify what my pain points were and allowed me to fix them. With my more refined mockups, I was then able to overlay the 90’s inspired branding. This resulted in me creating high-fidelity mockups that were ready to be tested out as a clickable prototype through Figma.</p>

                <h3>USABILITY TESTING</h3>
                  <p>Nothing is ever truly perfect, that is why I continued to run my mockups through a gambit of user tests. I wanted to make sure to iron out any issues or errors that possibly could and would pop up with what I had created. This resulted with me redesigning my add ice cream icon, retooling my tracking map, and even adding in additional screens for my menu. Some of these issues could be considered small but to me it didn’t matter because in the long run, big or small, any resolved issue or error would result in a better overall product.</p>

              <p>It is interesting how my simple idea of creating an ice cream app morphed and changed into what it is today. Even though it wasn’t what I first envisioned, I’m happy with how it turned out. It was great listening to user feedback and hearing that my prototype was hitting the mark and they thought it was solid. It was especially nice hearing that it made them feel like they were being transported back to the 90’s or that they could see an ice cream truck coming. They were fun comments but ones that made me think that I indeed created a product intended for the audience based on the research and user personas that were developed.</p>

              <p>However, as I said within my user testing results, nothing is ever truly perfect and my app could always be improved. I believe if I conducted additional user tests I could find even more errors that need to be refined, especially if I targeted different demographics. For the tests that I did conduct I made sure to ask individuals that somewhat fell under my intended users. This gave me almost biased results because they inherently understood what I was intending with my designs and thought process. So, I am curious if what I created would work for those that are not my intended audience. Would they give it praise still or would it turn them away, because yes you design for certain users in mind but you hope at the end of the day that anyone could enjoy what you made.</p>
