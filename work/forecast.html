                <h2>FORECAST</h2>
                  <p>Ever unexpectedly get caught in the rain when you decided to wear that now ruined new outfit?</p>

                  <p>Forecast is a cloud-based fashion website that lets the user plan their outfits out with peace of mind. The site shows the user customized items based on their preferences that they then can save and collect so that they can create their own perfect outfit. All the while the website is alerting them to the forecast so they can never be unprepared again.</p>

                <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
                  <p>The initial problem provided was open ended to allow for interpretation. To create a website to compete in the cloud storage and organization market like the big names of Google Drive, Dropbox and even Pinterest. Knowing that just creating a “normal” cloud storage website wouldn't be able to compete with these these large contenders I looked for a niche that would benefit from such a website. Knowing that the much beloved organizational fashion website, Polyvore, had recently shut down I knew this was my way in. To then further separate the website, I researched other problems that people face when trying to plan for outfits and one stood out the most, the weather.</p>

            <div class="column-50 information-text half-width-padding">

                <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
                  <p>Fashion apps out there, including Polyvore, focused greatly on the collection and organization of items. Yet, when these items were organized into outfits these sites didn’t do much with them, which seemed like a waste. When people plan outfits for a special occasion they know what day these events will take place. So with Forecast, the website took outfits a step further and allows the user to pick and modify their created outfits for the week. This giving the website it’s first meaning of forecast. The user is allowed to estimate what they will likely be wearing that day. While, the second meaning, an actual weather forecast is displayed along with the outfit the user picked. This alerting the user as to what the day will be like and if they should change their mind on what they planned on wearing. This takes the guessing out of the user’s morning routine and just allows them to know. No longer does someone have to worry about wearing too much on a hot day, too little on a cold day, etc... because the Forecast website has you rain or shine.

                  <p>I asked general questions to an audience that have used competitor fashion websites as well as those that like fashion. I asked questions like, what websites do they use, did people use these websites often, and do these websites help them determine what to wear. This leading me to find out that my demographic were females, 18 to 35 year olds that are either in school or employed. They are not high high fashion but they care about what they look and some even take great pride in their outfits. They plan out what they are going to wear to work and especially on dates or other special events.</p>

That was why I went with a more sleek and modern style of design and font. This was to compliment the clothing.

                <h3>PROTOTYPE PREFERENCE AND USABLITY TESTING</h3>
                  <p>High fidelity mockups were not the end. Instead this lead to multiple rounds of additional user tests to point out any errors or elements that were not working or could work better. For Forecast there were important elements that were completely missing that were caught by these tests. Which I then was able to put in and help the users flow through the site even more easily. Even the smallest of things like an acceptance button really does help.</p>

              <p>Overall, I feel content with how my website turned out. Even based on user testing, hearing that people really enjoyed the the colors and imagery that I had picked. That it felt very fashionable with the brand feeling something akin to a Loft, Lord & Taylor or other department store types. Was very nice to know, since this feels on brand based on the research and user personas that were created. It’s in the vibe of those that want to look nice in an attainable way, versus something that you’d find on the runway which your average millenial probably couldn’t afford. The website feels like a fashion website to the female users which is great.</p>

              <p>The main downfall, however, is that the website does feel very feminine, modern and sleek yet still feminine. Which is based on my user personas but I was hoping I could bridge the gap from female users to male users since planning outfits is not just a female thing. Maybe down the line this is something to think about with a kind of phase two. Where the website is more geared toward gaining a female following at first and then more male options later on can be added for male users. Since the website does feel very modern, I think it could appeal toward males especially if the pink were to be removed and just a nice grayscale was used. This would keep the same sleek look but feel more unisex overall which has been a huge trend in fashion.</p>
